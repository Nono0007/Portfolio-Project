# Portfolio-Project
My project helps people to Know me better who's Noreen, what she do and what she likes. I develop this website alone. I created this project for me and focused on me to help myself to show myself to the world and to show case what I can do as a junior developer and to boost my front end skills as I was designing this website.
I do discover that I love myself and the only way to put myself out there is to introduce myself in a unique way, by telling people who am I. I also learn that it all begins with me the way I market myself the way people discover me fast and want to try me.
Here is the link https://lnkd.in/dvNE4-mg to data flow chart feel free to check it out. I use the following technologies to create my website HTML5, CSS, JS

I opted to use these 3 because I want to specialize in front end and these 3 are the best and it helped me a lot to understand JS and how to use it properly and HTML and JS is the best when it comes to front end and website developing.
Feature: The website is responsive and compatible with mobile and any device, this means users can access the project from a mobile view.
The project does have backend which means it does have value for the end user.

My main goal on this project was to create a responsive website for myself but I face the most unexpected technical challenge I have never thought of. My contact form wasn't responsive because of the way I write my PHP which takes me a day to realize the problem and 2 days trying to solve it, when I noticed that I can't solve it I had to ask for help from my peers and we spend almost 3h hours trying to solve it but we couldn't. I had to call one of the senior developer's I know who I had to share codes with and he get back to me in the next 24 hours and tell me where I did go wrong and share some YouTube videos that helped me to solve the case in less than 2 hours, and I managed to present my project in time.

The technical take-away: I managed to complete my project exactly the way I wanted and I'm very happy.
If I get to do the same project again I would like to collaborate and try using JS only and see how beautiful will my website look.
As an upcoming engineer I learn that in order to be a great engineer you need to push extra hard and do a lot of research that's the only way to go.
This project informs my engineering path very beautiful if I keep up the hard work and keep on pushing.

I confirm that Visual studio code is easy and simple to use to all the upcoming engineers.
My name is Noreen Magaya and I'm an upcoming front end developer in the making, young and focused girl who's passionate about coding and do everything I do with love.
